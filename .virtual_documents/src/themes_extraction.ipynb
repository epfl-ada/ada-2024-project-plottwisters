#We decided to use a ChatGPT API which allows us to extract one single theme from each movie summary. The prompt we give to the algorithm to extract the theme is : 
#"Label the movie's theme with a single word based on its plot : ". Then, we clean the results to get rid of all the unwanted characters and store everything in the movie dataframe.
